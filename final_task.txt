Problem:


The problem is that disadvantaged and minority communities in the Bronx today do not have access to modern education, advanced resources and high tech opportunities in order to advance the careers of young adults in the 21st century.


The effect of this problem impacts the poverty rates, social integration of persons of color, as well as the fact that the voices of minorities are not being heard in government.


Pain points include high crime areas, gangland violence, unsanitary conditions, old building infrastructure, lack of access to stimulating environments, unhealthy eating habits.  The quality of education is the key to success in life, and if a community is lacking good teachers that will guide you through this constantly fast phase changing world, it will be hard for the individual to successfully navigate when there are so many distractions outside.

The gap between the poor and the rich is getting bigger, so we must put more towards the community.


The current situation creates a generational cycle of revolving poverty, missed opportunities and perceived systematic imbalances.


This hurts young adults the most as they are not even aware that their futures are already written for them.


Solution:


Young people are naturally drawn to playing games.  However, not all games are counterproductive to learning.  They provide stimulation, problem solving, and collaboration.  Therefore the solution is to create a community via a free continuing educational gaming program for big thinkers that connects young adults, small businesses, and donors to educate students about coding, design, new technology areas.  By using games, students will want to get rewarded for tasks in which they simultaneously educate themselves on tech careers.  The lessons are the game.
